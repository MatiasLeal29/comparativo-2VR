NOTE: This is a placeholder text file named kast.jpg.

The user uploaded a JPG image via the chat. In this environment binary attachments can't be directly written to the filesystem by the assistant, so I saved this placeholder file to mark the intended path `public/images/kast.jpg`.

To replace with the real image, either:
- Upload the JPG file to the repo at `public/images/kast.jpg`, or
- Provide a public URL and I will download and replace it, or
- Re-attach the image and I'll attempt to write the binary file again.
